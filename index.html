    <h2>Let's Start the Journey of a SHY Boy love stroy!</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>HERE THE BOY WHO's NAME IS DELOYAR AND THE GIRL NAME IS LIZA</h3>
        Deloyar was a shy and soft-spoken boy, known for his calm demeanor and love for books. He preferred to sit in the back of his classes, avoiding attention. But there was one thing—or rather, one person—that made his heart race: Liza. She was vibrant, confident, and always surrounded by friends. Deloyar admired her from afar, mesmerized by her laughter and the way her eyes sparkled when she spoke.

Months passed, and Deloyar's feelings for Liza grew stronger. He decided he couldn’t keep his emotions locked away forever. With a racing heart, he wrote a heartfelt letter and handed it to her after class one day. “I like you, Liza,” he stammered, his face flushing red.

Liza was caught off guard. She didn’t dislike Deloyar, but he wasn’t someone she had ever thought about romantically. Politely, she told him she wasn’t interested and walked away, leaving Deloyar disheartened but not bitter.

Despite her initial rejection, Deloyar didn’t let his feelings cloud his behavior. He continued to be kind and respectful, never pressuring Liza. In time, they started talking casually during group projects and shared light conversations about their favorite books and movies. Liza began to see a different side of Deloyar—his quiet humor, his intelligence, and his thoughtfulness.

One day, it started raining unexpectedly after class. Liza was stuck without an umbrella. Seeing her dilemma, Deloyar silently handed her his and walked away in the rain. That small gesture stayed with her. Slowly, she started noticing how genuinely kind he was—not just to her but to everyone around him.

As days turned into weeks, Liza found herself seeking out Deloyar. She enjoyed their conversations and admired how he always remembered little details about her, like her favorite coffee or the book she had been wanting to read. Bit by bit, her feelings for him began to change.

One evening, as they walked home from campus together, Liza stopped him. “You know,” she said with a shy smile, “I think I like you, Deloyar.”

Deloyar’s eyes widened in disbelief, but then his lips curved into a rare, radiant smile.

From that day forward, their relationship blossomed. Liza loved how Deloyar made her feel cherished, and Deloyar adored Liza’s energy and warmth. They balanced each other perfectly, proving that sometimes, love just needs a little time to grow.
